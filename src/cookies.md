## COOKIE POLICY

Last updated May 22, 2024

This Cookie Policy explains how Startr LLC ("Company," "we," "us," and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at https://canadians.love/ai ("Website"). It explains these technologies, why we use them, and your rights to control our use.

We may use cookies to collect personal information, which becomes personal if we combine it with other information.

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Website owners widely use cookies to improve the performance of their websites and provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Start LLC) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer when it visits the website in question and when it visits certain other websites.

### Why do we use cookies?

We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties use cookies on our website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

### How can I control cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can manage cookies through your web browser settings. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide services.

If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website, though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. For users who prefer not to keep cookies, we recommend accessing our site in private or incognito mode, available in most web browsers.

### How can I control cookies on my browser?

As how you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information. Here is information about how to manage cookies on the most popular browsers:

- **Google Chrome**: Use Incognito Mode or adjust your cookie settings in the browser settings menu.
- **Mozilla Firefox**: Use Private Browsing mode or manage your cookies through the privacy settings.
- **Apple Safari**: Use Private Browsing mode or configure your cookie preferences in the Safari settings.
- **Microsoft Edge**: Use InPrivate Browsing mode or adjust your cookie settings via the Edge settings menu.

The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):

What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These tiny graphics files contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. These technologies often rely on cookies to function correctly, so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

### Do you serve targeted advertising?

We avoid serving any advertising and do not currently use any third-party advertising services.

### How often will you update this Cookie Policy?

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Therefore, please revisit this cookie policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.
