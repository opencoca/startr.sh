**Introducing Seatbelts: Mac and Linux Security That Gets Out of Your Way**

As professionals, we all need security—but not at the cost of productivity. That's why I'm excited to share Seatbelts, a new approach to macOS and Linux security that respects your workflow.

Seatbelts is a "low touch" security auditor that:
• Runs silently in the background
• Checks 30+ critical security settings
• Alerts you ONLY when issues are found (via GitHub)
• Respects exceptions you need for your work
• Requires zero security expertise

Whether you're a developer, creative professional, or remote worker who can't afford IT-related interruptions, Seatbelts provides peace of mind without the constant nagging of traditional security tools.

Installation takes just seconds with a simple command, and it's completely open source.
