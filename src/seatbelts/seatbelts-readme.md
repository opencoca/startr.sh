# Seatbelts üîí

> A low-touch, unintrusive security auditor for macOS.

Seatbelts is a security auditing tool designed for macOS that runs as a Bats test suite and pushes results to a Git repository. When tests fail, it mentions the user in commit messages, triggering GitHub notifications.

## Features

- **Low-touch**: Runs in the background without interrupting your workflow
- **Powerful**: Audits a wide range of security settings across system, application, and network domains
- **Unintrusive**: Respects your workflow by allowing exceptions for required features
- **Alerting**: Triggers GitHub notifications when security issues are found
- **Customizable**: Easily extend with new tests or modify existing ones
